For the size of the table, I took the size of the original array and ran it as is. I then went into the result and found when the results started to cluster, ignoring the outliers, and found the closest thousand to that point. I calculated the alpha of that and set it into my program. I then made sure that, should a prime value greater than the new size was used, it would circle back to the start however many times is necissary in order for the hash to be within the new size.

I used the same equation for the internal hash table size, but I was trying to add a alpha value to the internal hashtable and I kept running into an error so I left it as the size only.
